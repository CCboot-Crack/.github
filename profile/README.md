# Key Features of CCBoot:

1. **Diskless Booting** â€“ Clients boot from a central server instead of using local hard drives.

2. **Centralized Management** â€“ Manage OS, updates, and software from a single server.

3. **Automatic Updates** â€“ Any updates made on the master image apply to all clients.

4. **Game & Software Preloading** â€“ Ideal for gaming centers where new games and updates can be deployed easily.

5. **Write-back Protection** â€“ Prevents unwanted changes; reboots restore the original state.

6. **High-Speed Performance** â€“ Uses RAM caching and SSD storage to improve client boot speed.

7. **Support for Multiple OS** â€“ Can boot different versions of Windows and Linux.

8. **Data Persistence** â€“ Allows certain partitions to retain data after reboot (if configured).

# How CCBoot Works:

A server stores OS images, software, and configurations.

Client PCs PXE boot from the network using the CCBoot server.

The server loads the OS image into the clientâ€™s RAM, acting as a virtual hard drive.

Users operate normally, but changes are discarded upon reboot unless persistent storage is enabled.

# Common Uses:

Internet cafÃ©s and gaming centers to reduce maintenance.

Schools & labs to simplify OS and software management.

Offices & corporate environments to enhance security and efficiency.
